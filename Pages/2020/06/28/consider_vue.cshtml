      One the most helpful tech tips I've received over the years was be willing to bring your work home. I think the importance of passion is mostly exaggerated but
      in certain fields like tech it has a place.

    <div class="row mt-4">
      We don't have the luxuries that comes with a stable rarely changing industry like medicine or law. If you
      aren't naturally curious you may struggle staying relevant in a field that changes so quickly.

      So as a challenge to fully understand <a style="display:contents" href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js</a>
      I'm going through this
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://strapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strapi.js</a>
      /
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React.js</a>
      course but instead I'm implementing everything on the frontend in Vue.
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-4">
      And so far it has made me more bullish on Vue. It can do everything React can but without the added "made this extra hard for job security" complexity.

      I definitely recommend building a side project with it. I've
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://www.michiganwaterpolo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        built a complete site for a client using it
      </a>
      and it will continue to be my first choice. And luckily
      it's simple enough to added to any exisiting web project without much headache.

    <div class="row mt-4">
      <a style="display:contents" href="    https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Drop a script tag in and start building.
      </a>
      And for you senior engineers that need adoption metrics before considering
      new technolgy, take a look at their
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github stars.</a>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-4">
      While not a perfect metric, being higher than both
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>
      and
      <a style="display:contents" href="https://github.com/angular/angular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a>
      shows that the industry is watching. Increased enterprise support is sure to follow.
