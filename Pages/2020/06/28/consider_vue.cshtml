    I'm going through this
    <a style="display:contents" href="https://strapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strapi.js</a>

  </div>
  <div class="row mt-4">
    While not a perfect metric, being higher than both
    <a style="display:contents" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>
    and
    <a style="display:contents" href="https://github.com/angular/angular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a>
    shows that the industry is watching. Increased enterprise support is sure to follow.
