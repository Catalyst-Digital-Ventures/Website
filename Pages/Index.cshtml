          <h3>Agile is key</h3>
          <p>
            CDV adheres to the Agile framework called Scrum which uses an
            iterative development cycle concept called Sprints.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entire software development life cycle (SDLC) takes place over the 2
            week sprint allowing us the tools to adapt to changes and maximize
            project success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The continuous feedback loop fostered with the Agile approach
            illuminates problems earlier than with other methodologies.
            Instead of only one long iteration of performing SDLC
            activities sequentially, an Agile team repeatedly performs these
            activities in short durations.

            I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Michigan. Professionally, my exposure to technology started when I was 15 after earning
            an internship at a local computer repair shop in Detroit, Michigan. While my friends were playing basketball I was building PCs
            and learning the difference between IDE and SATA cables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building and repairing computers was all I thought about. Tomshardware.com and anandtech.com quickly became my most visted websites.
            I soon realized technology was the industry for me so I started freelancing in-home pc repair services mainly dealing with removing
            viruses and improving performance and got my first taste of entrepreneurship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later I earned my Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems from Grand Valley State University. The program focused on intersection of
            technology and business with an emphasis on Enterprise Resource Planning software. Eventually I got an internship with GE Aviation then
            later a job with Infor Inc. where I learned the importance of teamwork, customer service and solving problems quickly. 
          </p>
            <p>
            This is also where I saw firsthand just how important software and cloud computing was becoming. Being a hardware guy, it wasn’t something I accepted
            immediately but eventually I couldn’t ignore it. In 2016 I became an eternal student of software engineering and haven't looked back since. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019 after reading Grant Cardone's 10X Rule I finally got the courage to start my own consulting company Catalyst Digital Ventures, LLC.
            Through the tireless effort of so many people I realized I have the tools to help my community migrate into the digital age.

          </p>
          <p>
            Life has taught me the only thing you regret is you didn't do it sooner.
