                    <h3>Agile is key</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        CDV adheres to the Agile framework called Scrum which uses an
                        iterative development cycle concept called Sprints.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The entire software development life cycle (SDLC) takes place over the 2
                        week sprint allowing us the tools to adapt to changes and maximize
                        project success.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The continuous feedback loop fostered with the Agile approach
                        illuminates problems earlier than with other methodologies.
                        Instead of only one long iteration of performing SDLC
                        activities sequentially, an Agile team repeatedly performs these
                        activities in short durations.

                        I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Michigan. Professionally, my exposure to technology started when I was 15 after earning
                        an internship at a local computer repair shop in Detroit, Michigan. While my friends were playing basketball and video games I was learning about
                        AGP graphic cards and BIOS troubleshooting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During those years building and repairing computers was all I thought about.<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> TomsHardware</a> 
                        and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> AnandTech </a> quickly became my favorite websites. I soon realized technology was the industry for me so I started freelancing 
                        in-home pc repair services mainly dealing with removing viruses and improving performance and got my first taste of entrepreneurship.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Years later I earned my Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems from Grand Valley State University. The program focused on intersection of
                        technology and business with an emphasis on Enterprise Resource Planning software. While there I got an internship with GE Aviation followed by
                        a job with Infor Gloabl Solutions Inc. where I learned the importance of teamwork, customer service and solving problems quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This is also where I saw firsthand just how important software and cloud computing was becoming. Being a hardware guy, it wasn’t something I accepted
                        immediately but eventually I couldn’t ignore it. In 2015 I became an eternal student of software engineering and haven't looked back since.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In 2019 after reading Grant Cardone's 10X Rule I realized the only thing you'll regret is you didn't do it sooner. So I started Catalyst Digital Ventures, LLC.
                        Through the tireless effort of so many people I have gained skills to help my community migrate into the digital age.
