      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <h3>Agile is key</h3>
        <p>
          CDV adheres to the Agile framework called Scrum which uses an
          iterative development cycle concept called Sprints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire software development life cycle (SDLC) takes place over the 2
          week sprint allowing us the tools to adapt to changes and maximize
          project success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continuous feedback loop fostered with the Agile approach
          illuminates problems earlier than with other methodologies.
          Instead of only one long iteration of performing SDLC
          activities sequentially, an Agile team repeatedly performs these
          activities in short durations.

        <p>
          I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Michigan, USA. Professionally, my exposure to technology started when I was 15 after earning
          an internship at a local computer repair shop in Detroit, Michigan. While my friends were playing basketball and video games I was learning about
          AGP graphic cards and BIOS troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          During those years building and repairing computers was all I thought about.<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> TomsHardware</a>
          and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> AnandTech </a> quickly became frequently visited websites. I quickly realized technology was
          the industry for me I got my first taste of entrepreneurship by doing freelance in-home pc repair services mainly dealing with removing viruses and improving performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years later I earned my Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems from Grand Valley State University. I picked this major becuase I was fortunate enough to understand how
          important computing was becoming in business.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <p>
          The program focused on intersection of technology and business with an emphasis on Enterprise Resource Planning software.
          During my studies I earned an internship with GE Aviation followed by a job with Infor Gloabl Solutions Inc. where I learned the importance of teamwork, customer service and
          solving problems quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also where I saw firsthand just how important software and cloud computing was becoming. Being a hardware guy, it wasn’t something I accepted
          immediately but eventually I couldn’t ignore it. In 2015 I became an eternal student of software engineering and haven't looked back since.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 after reading Grant Cardone's 10X Rule I realized <span class="font-weight-bold" style="display:contents">
            the only thing you'll regret is you didn't do it sooner.
          </span> So I started Catalyst Digital Ventures to help position my community to benefit from the digitalization of society.
