      <div class="col-sm">
        <h3>Agile is key</h3>
        <p>
          CDV adheres to the Agile framework called Scrum which uses an
          iterative development cycle concept called Sprints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire software development life cycle (SDLC) takes place over the 2
          week sprint allowing us the tools to adapt to changes and maximize
          project success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continuous feedback loop fostered with the Agile approach
          illuminates problems earlier than with other methodologies.
          Instead of only one long iteration of performing SDLC
          activities sequentially, an Agile team repeatedly performs these
          activities in short durations.

        I'm a Full-Stack Engineer from Detroit Michigan, USA. My exposure to technology started by chance in middle school when the frustration of being trapped at my mom's 
        hair salon lead me to wondering inside a nearby computer repair shop. What started as a way to escape being surrounded by old ladies and hair spray lead to an intership 
        and new found passion. While my friends were playing basketball and video games I was learning about AGP graphic cards and BIOS troubleshooting.

        During those years building and repairing computers was all I thought about.<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> TomsHardware</a>
        and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> AnandTech </a> quickly became frequently visited websites. I quickly realized technology was
        the industry for me and got my first taste of entrepreneurship by doing freelance in-home pc repair services mainly dealing with removing viruses and improving performance.

      In 2019 after reading <a  style="display:contents" href="https://amzn.to/2BQ6XQF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Grant Cardone's 10X Rule</a> I realized
      <span class="font-weight-bold" style="display:contents"> the only thing you'll regret is you didn't do it sooner. </span>  So I started Catalyst Digital Ventures to help
      position not only myself but my community to benefit from the digitalization of society.
